        <ul>
            <li>Check Console for details. This example parses each node in the dom (p tag in our example). It prints only top level elements, by using nextSibling() function.</li>
            <li>Note w.nextNode() call is made to point to firt node (after p tag which is text node) and then nextSibling() will make sure only top elements are stored & there h3 tag is not printed as it is inside span tag</li>
